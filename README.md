# Manage Beatmap

The beatmap management helper tool for osu!. Mostly designed for osu!Taiko mode, however it *should* work on other modes as well. Some functions require the osu!Taiko mode to work, such as repositioning the notes, which would be catastrophic if applied on any other mode.

## Features

Main features could be listed such as:

- Adding SV changes smoothly in between two times,
- Equalizing SV by either applying it on a fresh map, or selecting a range of points,
- Applying smooth SV changes between selected point range,
- Applying smooth volume changes between selected point range,
- Changing the BPM of a red point which allows the notes and other red & green points to be shifted accordingly automatically,
- Replacing whistle hitsounds as claps,
- Repositioning notes (taiko mode only),
- Changing the metadata of a map (does it as a batch, may have bugs for now.)

The app is mostly used for either "Equalizing SV for variable timings" or "Adding SV smoothly" functions, but I use almost all functions while mapping something. From what people have told me and in my experience, this tool is a time saver, and I really suggest you to use it if you deal with complex SV changes.
